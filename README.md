# nordvpn-install for RPM-OSTREE

Install the NordVPN client on Fedora Silverblue!    Just download the install.sh, make sure you have a toolbox created and are in a sudo enabled account and then run the script.

I have edited the nordvpn install.sh to add rpm-ostree functionality, for silverblue, in my case.  It is probably buggy as I haven't tested it properly yet, but it works for me.
